# RE:Style - Restyling MyAnimeList in Another CSS

Welcome to my MAL Re_Style. It's basically a third iteration of the style sheet I've been using since 2012. I don't like when style sheets are fragmented, hard to understand, or when they break with every MAL update, so I created to most customizable, yet conventional one I could come up with. Yes, it's a choice. I even chose not to add resizable covers because I knew they would break eventually. The MAL blackout and the subsequent rule changes proved me right.

If you want to use it, all you have to do is copy all the content of the CSS into your list's custom CSS box. You can then choose a preset color palette from those I have included or choose your own colors. Anyone who knows what they're doing can go even deeper, but I'm not here to give a tutorial; there's plenty of them around. PS: It's <b>MODERN ONLY!</b>

*Choose from one of these or create your own color palette!*
