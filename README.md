# MALstyles

To use a style, copy and paste the following line on a blank modern theme template on MAL: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_[coulour].css";</pre>

Of course, remember to replace [coulour] by an available colour from this repository.

PS: These themes do not currently work on the white theme templates. It does work on the default and dark themes. I might eventually work on overriding the white theme overrides that make them incompatible, but it's far from a priority.
