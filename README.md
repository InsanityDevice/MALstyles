# MALstyles

These themes were created to support 2016's redesigned (modern) version of the MAL styles.

*Warning*: I have modified the fonts a little since then.

To use a style, copy and paste the RAW version of the desired CSS file into the "Add custom CSS" section of any modern template.

With the <code>@import</code> function now disabled on MAL (as of July 20th 2018), I am removing web fonts from the equation and changing it to Verdana, since it's probably one of the best fonts that is readily available on every respectable OS that I know of.

Here are the links to my anime and manga pages if you want live exemples of my styles: [Anime list](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Insanitium?status=7)/[Manga list](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/Insanitium?status=7)

And finally, for whoever is curious about what the old theme looked like (with the classic, pre-2016 MAL CSS format): [here is a screenshot of the old orange theme](http://i.imgur.com/MqwG1G1.jpg). Red and blue versions were also available. They don't work anymore because they were hosted on Dropbox (which changed its hosting policy) and were fragmented. It would be too much work for me to reupload every image used in it and re-link them. You can always ask me to send you the files if you know your way around CSS code.
