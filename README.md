# MALstyles

These styles were created to support the 2016 updated version of the MAL themes.

Screenshots(the wallpapers and banners are not included in the css files): [Red](http://i.imgur.com/JMPvV9I.png)/[Blue](http://i.imgur.com/UDpGJhQ.png)/[Orange](http://i.imgur.com/hFMfQTr.png)/[Green](http://i.imgur.com/ZQRfhmc.png)/[Turquoise](http://i.imgur.com/47co7kh.png)

To use a style, copy and paste the following line on a blank modern theme template on MAL: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_[colour].css";</pre>

Of course, remember to replace [colour] by an available colour from this repository. i.e.: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_red.css";</pre>
The link should redirect you towards the appropriate css file if you enter it in your navigation bar.

And finally, for whoever is curious about the old theme (with the old, pre-2016 MAL CSS format): [Old orange theme](http://i.imgur.com/MqwG1G1.jpg)
