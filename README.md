# MALstyles

To use a style, copy and paste the following line on a blank modern theme template on MAL: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_[colour].css";</pre>

Of course, remember to replace [colour] by an available colour from this repository. i.e.: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_red.css";</pre>
The link should redirect you towards the appropriate css file if you enter it in your navigation bar.
