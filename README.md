# MALstyles

These themes were created to support 2016's redesigned (modern) version of the MAL styles.

Screenshots (the wallpapers and banners are not included in the css files): [Red](http://i.imgur.com/JMPvV9I.png)/[Blue](http://i.imgur.com/UDpGJhQ.png)/[Orange](http://i.imgur.com/sw1DAAm.png)/[Green](http://i.imgur.com/ZQRfhmc.png)/[Turquoise](http://i.imgur.com/47co7kh.png)/[Purple](http://i.imgur.com/3rTxAy8.png)/[Silver](http://i.imgur.com/QJbarNI.png)

To use a style, copy and paste the following line on a blank modern theme template on MAL: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_[colour].css";</pre>

Of course, remember to replace [colour] by an available colour from this repository. i.e.: <pre>@import "https://InsanityDevice.github.io/MALstyles/MAL_red.css";</pre>
The link should redirect you towards the appropriate css file if you enter it in your navigation bar.

Here are the links to my anime and manga pages if you want live exemples of my styles: [Anime list](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Insanitium?status=7)/[Manga list](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/Insanitium?status=7)

And finally, for whoever is curious about what the old theme looked like (with the classic, pre-2016 MAL CSS format): [here is a screenshot of the old orange theme](http://i.imgur.com/MqwG1G1.jpg). Red and blue versions were also available. They don't work anymore because they were hosted on Dropbox (which changed its hosting policy) and were fragmented. It would be too much work for me to reupload every image used in it and re-link them. You can always ask me to send you the files if you know your way around CSS code.
